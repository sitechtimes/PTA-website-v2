      <p>The mission of Staten Island Tech’s PTA is to support our school through advocacy, volunteerism, and fundraising.
          From our bake sales to our annual Spring Gala, we work diligently to raise money in order to financially support
          our school’s needs such as online and software services, facility upgrades, and social events / celebrations.</p>
      <p class="mt-3">While Staten Island Tech provides a strong academic environment for our children, the school cannot do this
          alone. Participating with the PTA is vital to our students and school community. Please join our meeting each
          month to learn about the ongoing activities and events that help make our school a success. Also, <b>please support
          our school with our suggested donations towards PTA dues. No amount is too small or too great.</b></p>
